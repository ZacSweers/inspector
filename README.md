Inspector
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hzsweers/inspector.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hzsweers/inspector)

Inspector is a tiny class validation tool that has a tiny, flexible, and powerful API.

If you've ever used Moshi or GSON, it should feel very familiar.

The base type is `Inspector`, which can contain any number of `Validator`s or `Validator.Factory`s.

Like Moshi, Inspector operates on `Type`s directly. Validation is a decentralized, pluggable system. 
There is a reflective class-based validator generator if you want, or you can use the `inspector-compiler` 
annotation processor to generate validator implementations for you.

Validation normally operates on method return types. Everything is assumed non-null, unless annotated 
with one of the number of `@Nullable` annotations out there. Nullability is the only validation run 
out of the box by the reflective adapter as well. Inspector is purposefully stupid, you know your own models!

Usage looks like this:

```java
Inspector inspector = new Inspector.Builder()
    .add(Foo.class, new FooValidator())
    .add(BarValidator.FACTORY)
    .add(...)  // Whatever you want!
    .build();

boolean isValid = inspector.validator(Foo.class).isValid(myFooStance);

// Or more aggressively, but with descriptive error messages
try {
  inspector.validator(Foo.class).validate(myFooInstance);
} catch (ValidationException e) {
  // Server's sending you bad stuff
}
```

Note that you have two ways of checking validation: the non-throwing `isValid()` method for quick 
boolean checks, or the throwing `validate()` method that throws an exception with potentially more 
information.

### Annotations

`@ValidationQualifier` - Like Moshi's `@JsonQualifier` or javax's `@Qualifer`. Use these on your own 
annotations to create custom validators with interesting implementations.

`@InspectorExcluded` - Use this to exclude methods from validation.

`@ValidatedBy(SomeValidator.class)` - Use this to designate that this should be validated by 
a specified validator. Note that if you use this reflectively, it must also be reflectively instantiable.

### inspector-compiler

Features:
- Annotation processor that generates validator implementations
- Supports a service-loader-based extensions API via `InspectorExtension`
  - First party implementations are under the `compiler-extensions` directory
- Validator implementation is generated in the same package in a `Validator_<YourClass>.java`

Simply add a static `Validator`-returning method to your model and be sure to annotate it with 
something to look for, such as `@AutoValue` (this can be done automatically via the `inspector-autovalue-compiler-extension`).

First party extensions:
- `inspector-android-compiler-extension`: Generates validation for Android support annotations
- `inspector-autovalue-compiler-extension`: Tells the inspector compiler to look for `@AutoValue` annotations
- `inspector-nullability-compiler-extension`: Generates nullability validation based on the presence of `@Nullable` annotations
- `inspector-rave-compiler-extension`: Generates validation for RAVE annotations

```java
@AutoValue
public abstract class Foo {
  
  public abstract String bar();
  
  public static Validator<Foo> validator(Inspector inspector) {
    // Generated class is in the same package, prefixed with "Validator_"
    return new Validator_Foo(insepctor);
  }
}
```

If you have a lot of these, you may not want to manually have to hook all these up to an inspector instance. To solve 
this, there are two batteries-included options you can use.
 
The `inspector-factory-compiler` annotation processor can generate a factory implementation that 
delegates to all the types on that compilation path. Simply stub a factory class like so:

```java
@InspectorFactory(include = AutoValue.class) 
public abstract class MyFactory implements Validator.Factory {
  public static MyFactory create() {
    return new InspectorFactory_MyFactory();
  }
}
```

- Your class must implement ValidatorFactory and not be `final`.
- You mark which annotations you want to target your factory to, such as `@AutoValue`.
- An `InspectorFactory_<YourClassName>` will be generated in the same package for referencing with an implementation
 of the `create()` method.
 
The other option is to use `@GenerateValidator`. Simply annotate desired types with this, and a `Validator`
implementation will be generated (regardless of the presence of a static `Validator`-returning method). You
can read these via optional `Validator.Factory` implementation in the annotation via `GenerateValidator.FACTORY`.
 
```java
@GenerateValidator
class Foo {
  public String bar() {
    //...
  }
}

// Later
Inspector inspector = new Inspector.Builder()
    .add(GenerateValidator.FACTORY)
    .build();

inspector.validator(Foo.class).validate(fooInstance); // Validator_Foo.java will be dynamically looked up!
```

### Tools

There's some helpful tools available:
* `CompositeValidator` for composing multiple `Validator`s for a given type/property.
* `Types` is a utility class with helpful factories for creating different `Type` implementations.
* Types can implement `SelfValidating` to indicate that they handle their own validation, and thus Inspector will just defer to that.
* There is an `inspector-retrofit` artifact with a [Retrofit][retrofit] `Converter.Factory` 
implementation that you can drop in to your network stack.

### Sample

There is a sample project under `inspector-sample` with nontrivial examples.

`inspector-sample-android` is just a for-fun proof of concept of how some non-generated support library annotation validators 
would look. This unfortunately is not currently possible since support annotations are not `RUNTIME` retained.

### Usage

Your gradle file could look like this:

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.sweers.inspector/inspector.svg)](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.sweers.inspector/inspector)

```gradle
depedencies {
  // Core Inspector library
  implementation 'io.sweers.inspector:inspector:x.y.z'
  
  // Compiler to generate validators, in a Java/Android project
  annotationProcessor 'io.sweers.inspector:inspector-compiler:x.y.z'
  
  // Or Kotlin (Â± Android)
  kapt 'io.sweers.inspector:inspector-compiler:x.y.z'
  
  // Compiler annotations
  implementation 'io.sweers.inspector:inspector-compiler-annotations:x.y.z'
  
  // Retrofit artifact
  implementation 'io.sweers.inspector:inspector-retrofit:x.y.z'
  
  // Optional compiler extensions
  compileOnly 'io.sweers.inspector:inspector-android-compiler-extension:x.y.z'
  compileOnly 'io.sweers.inspector:inspector-autovalue-compiler-extension:x.y.z'
  compileOnly 'io.sweers.inspector:inspector-nullability-compiler-extension:x.y.z'
  compileOnly 'io.sweers.inspector:inspector-rave-compiler-extension:x.y.z'
}
```

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's snapshots repository][snapshots].
