inspector-factory-compiler-annotations
======================================

This artifact contains necessary compile-time annotations for the `inspector-factory-compiler`. 
These are extracted so you can use them as a `compileOnly` dependency in Android projects without 
placing the full annotation processor in the factory compiler artifact on your classpath.

See the `inspector-factory-compiler` README for full documentation.
